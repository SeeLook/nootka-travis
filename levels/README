This directory contains Nootka exam levels distributed with the application.
They will be automatically loaded and visible inside Nootka on the level list.

Levels in this directory must have extra translatable tags:
<nameTR>translate("Levels", "Level name here")</nameTR>
<descriptionTR>translate("Levels", "Level description here")</descriptionTR>

Of course <level> tag must have some "name" attribute.
<level name="Level name here">

and to detect them correctly, lupdate has to be invoked in such a way:
lupdate -extensions cpp,h,qml,nel -recursive ../src ../levels -ts some_file.ts
from inside 'lang' directory

There are instrument specific levels inside subdirectories with name corresponding to instrument
